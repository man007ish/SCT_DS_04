Introduction
Traffic accidents are influenced by various factors, including road conditions, weather, and time of day. This project aims to analyze these factors to discover patterns and trends, and uses visualization tools to identify accident hotspots and better understand contributing causes. The insights can help in designing road safety interventions and preventive measures.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains traffic accident records, including information on:

Date: The date of the accident.
Time: Time of day when the accident occurred.
Weather conditions: Clear, rain, fog, snow, etc.
Road conditions: Dry, wet, icy, etc.
Location: Geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).
Severity: Severity of the accident (e.g., minor, serious, fatal).
You can obtain a dataset from various sources such as government open data portals or specific repositories like Kaggle or other traffic data sources.

Requirements
The following Python libraries are required for this project:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib folium scikit-learn
pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
numpy: For numerical operations.
seaborn & matplotlib: For visualizations.
folium: For geographical mapping and heatmaps.
scikit-learn: For potential clustering and analysis.

Data Preprocessing
Before analysis, data needs to be cleaned and preprocessed. Steps include:

Handling missing values: Dealing with missing or incomplete records in important columns like Time, Weather, Road Conditions, and Location.
Date and time parsing: Converting date and time fields into appropriate formats for analysis (e.g., extracting hours, days, months).
Categorizing weather and road conditions: Grouping weather and road conditions into categories (e.g., Clear, Rain, Fog for weather; Dry, Wet, Icy for road conditions).
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data/traffic_accidents.csv')

# Convert Date and Time fields
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])
df['Hour'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Time'], format='%H:%M').dt.hour

# Fill missing weather and road condition data
df['Weather'] = df['Weather'].fillna('Unknown')
df['Road_Condition'] = df['Road_Condition'].fillna('Unknown')
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The traffic_data_analysis.ipynb notebook explores key patterns and trends in the data:

Accidents by time of day: Distribution of accidents during different hours.
Weather conditions impact: Examining how different weather conditions contribute to accidents.
Road conditions impact: Analyzing how road surface conditions (dry, wet, icy) affect accident likelihood.
python
Copy code
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Visualizing accidents by time of day
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.countplot(x='Hour', data=df, palette='coolwarm')
plt.title('Accidents by Time of Day')
plt.xlabel('Hour of Day')
plt.ylabel('Number of Accidents')
plt.show()
Visualizing Accident Hotspots
Geographical accident hotspots are visualized using the Folium library. Hotspot analysis helps identify areas with the highest frequency of accidents, allowing authorities to prioritize safety improvements.

python
Copy code
import folium
from folium.plugins import HeatMap

# Create a map centered on the mean location of the accidents
accident_map = folium.Map(location=[df['Latitude'].mean(), df['Longitude'].mean()], zoom_start=12)

# Create a list of locations (latitude, longitude)
locations = df[['Latitude', 'Longitude']].dropna().values.tolist()

# Add a heatmap layer to the map
HeatMap(locations).add_to(accident_map)

# Display the map
accident_map
Contributing Factors Analysis
We explore correlations between accident severity and factors such as weather, road conditions, and time of day. Statistical analysis and visualization techniques like correlation heatmaps, bar plots, and box plots are used to identify relationships.

python
Copy code
# Correlation heatmap between factors
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Correlation between Contributing Factors')
plt.show()
